# selecting-a-school
_Just some open thoughts about which school and programs to think about._

It is hard to push to a Ph.D. program because I am not sure what I want to reach for. My current research is in HCI and language. So, I am not exactly a linguist.
But I am also not exactly a cognitive linguist. I need more skills in computer programing. I like information arangment in visual mediums.

I've looked at:
* J.D. + an M.A. in non-profit managment at U of O.
* Ph.D. in Linguistics at U of O.
* Ph.D. in Linguistics at UH M.
* LIS at at UH M.
* LIS at UBC: http://slais.ubc.ca/programs/degree-specializations/hci-sub-specialization/
* iSchool at Berkely
